Also they are not \r\nmeant to be a replacement for anything from the CoreMedia universe of tools and \r\ncomponents. They are intended for use as an integration tool or as a low level \r\nand limited performance access library. (There are no performance problems so \r\nfar. There simply is no performance to run into trouble with.)\r\n\r\nTo access the repository database of a Replication Live Server, each flavour \r\nuses the latest means of direct database access in broader use for the given \r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n## Available Libraries\r\n\r\nRight now there are just two version available\r\n\r\n[coconat.java](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/coconat.java)\r\n\r\nThe Java version of the library is the original one. It is derived from the \r\ntangram project where different repository types can be used as a basis one of \r\nthem being a CoreMedia content repository through the CoMA CoreMedia Adaptor. \r\nIf this library here stabilizes over time it will most likely replace large \r\nparts of it ancestor while the CoMA Adaptor might change into a glue layer like \r\nwith the other repository options.\r\n\r\n[coconat.php](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/coconat.php) (\"Phoconat\")\r\n\r\nDuring the last years I very often got into the very anoying Java or PHP \r\ndiscussion for web applications. So here it is: Access your content through PHP \r\nand do whatever you might feel like. Unlike the tangram solution this one still \r\nlacks.\r\n\r\n## Work in Progress\r\n\r\nA translation of the PHP based code to JavaScript is available in the \r\n[coconat.script](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/coconat.script) repository as a \r\nnot working starting point, where especially the database access parts are \r\nmissing.\r\n\r\n## Future Options\r\n\r\nIt would be fun to provide versions like e.g. for Phython (coconat.python) were \r\nI  already started to write some code and would accept any help. Other ideas \r\ninclude .NET (CoCon.NET) and Go (\"GoConAT\") - again  if someone would be willing \r\nto use and help to maintain them.\r\n",
